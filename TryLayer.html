    <p>I am in normal style</p>

    <div class="box1">
      <p>I am big, bold, but still red even though the color:blue is in a higher specificity selector and is declared later.
          This is because 1) layer/non-layer conflicts ignore specificity, and 2) they are hoisted to the beginning of the
          style definition and thus, the non-layer blue comes after the layer and "latest wins".</p>

    <div class="box2">
      <p>I am big, bold, but still red even though the color:red is in a higher specificity selector and is declared later.
          This is because 1) layer/non-layer conflicts ignore specificity, and 2) they are lifted to the beginning of the
          style definition and thus, the non-layer blue comes after the layer and "latest wins".</p>
