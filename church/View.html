    Eta reduction

    f = x => (expr_without_x) (x)   // eta reduction
    f =       expr_without_x

    In case there are more params one can reduce last (innermost) param with last argument

    f = w => x => (expr_without_x) (w) (x)   // eta reduction
    f = w =>      (expr_without_x) (w)       // now you can even reduce w, if ..

    Special cases:

    1) x is not last parameter, cannot reduce
       f = w => x => (expr_without_x) (x) (w)

       to make it last parameter, you can use flip before reduction
       f = w => x => flip (expr_without_x) (w) (x)    // eta
       f = w =>      flip (expr_without_x) (w)

    2) x appears at the end but is nested in the term

       Replace nesting with compose

        f = x => g(h(x))            // compose
        f = x => cmp(g)(h)(x)       // now we can eta-reduce
        f = cmp(g)(h)

       Referential transparency (part of), equational reasoning, term algebra
        f(x)(y)(z)                  // and
        g = f(x)                    // follows
        f(x)(y)(z) == g(y)(z)

       Any subterm can be extracted but mind the (maybe implicit) parentheses!
       => allows many optimizations and refactorings
